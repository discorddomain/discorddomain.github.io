## How do I make a domain?
- Step 0: Check if your domain is unavailable by going to https://domainmaker.github.io/DOMAINNAME (The domain name you want)
- Step 1: Make a file named CNAME in your github repo thats goes to domainmaker.github.io/DOMAINNAME <- Domain name of your choice
- Step 2: Make a pull request with the title as domain name of your choosing, and the description with a link to the repo that you want to have a domain.
- Step 3: Wait 1-2 days for me to get everything carried over

And your done!
